This project is an E-commerce app, It was really  challenging to implement the functionality and design. I am not a professional designer, I aimed to create a beautiful and user-friendly interface. I took the images from Pixabay.com and Pexels.com. I also included a payment functionality using Stripe, and useContext for the cart system. The database is implemented using MongoDB.


Technologies:
- React
- Nodejs
- MongoDB
- ExpressJs
- Stripe.
